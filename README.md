---How To Start---

To start the application cd into the correct directory and type npm install.
After the installation has finished type npm start and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

---How To Use---

To use the application simply login on the homepage and begin answering questions. To answer
a question simply click on view poll and choose one of the two options below. From there the
highlighted answer will turn green and the question's results will show up. You can now navigate
back to the homepage or to another page. You can use the new question link to make your own would
you rather question. You simply must input two options and click the submit button. You can also
see the leaderboard to see who has the highest score. Score is calculated by adding the number of
questions asked to the number of questions answered. Enjoy the application and have fun.

---Resources Used---

I've reused a few resources from the reactnd-chirper-app such as the middleware section.
I'd also like to thank sources like udacity's knowledge page and websites like stackoverflow
which helped me multiple times when trying to figure out bugs in my coding.
